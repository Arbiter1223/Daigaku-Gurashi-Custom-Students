### Additional information

When it was being debated whether or not Mayo, a *preset* student, should be changed from a female to a futa, I decided to act immediately. It had already been established that Mayo was a female, and I didn't like the idea of just changing stuff like this out of nowhere just to make "the perfect student." So to avoid having to make changes to the game canon, I made a futa version of Mayo to make everyone happy. (You're welcome.)
