### Additional information

Jiin is a stressed out but dedicated fashionista. While his parents wanted him to become a doctor or lawyer, Jiin's true passion comes from fashion. His dream is to make a clothing brand for all genders, all body types, and in many styles. Needless to say his parents didn't like this, and they kicked him out of their house when they found out he was homosexual. While Jiin is struggling to make it on his own, he still hopes to one day make clothing that will make everyone happy and confident in themselves.
