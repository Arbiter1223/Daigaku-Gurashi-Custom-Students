### Additional information

Mina is a character I found while getting footage for the V0.47 update for YamiToast. In showcasing the new accents I stumbled upon a sweet girl with an adorable third-person accent. It was during this time that I saw Mina say, "Mina's so hyped Mina can barely move-nya." I instantly knew she was a keeper and added her to the database.
