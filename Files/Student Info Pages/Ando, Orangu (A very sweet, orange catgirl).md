### Additional information

Orangu is a character who was initially created by RedPanda/Retsuko (now under a different alias) as a first attempt at creating a character depicting Syberian Orange. Orangu is a close friend to Jennyafur since they look very similar and share common interests. (I also figured they would make best friends since Orangu was uploaded very close to the time I first shared Jennyafur.) I liked Orangu so much that I decided to keep her, along with a few other students, up-to-date with the game so she would always be playable. (I later decided to do this with all students, thus creating the Custom Student Database).
