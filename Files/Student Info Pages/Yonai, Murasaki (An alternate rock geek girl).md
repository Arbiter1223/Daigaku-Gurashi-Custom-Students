### Additional information

Murasaki is a character Syberian Inc created for a friend whom she had convinced to start playing Daigaku Gurashi (Koukou Gurashi at the time). She wanted a character similar to Hisako in appearance who was also nice instead of mean. After the addition of multiple outfits to the game, Murasaki's fashion sense reminds me of the "Missing Texture" from the Source Engine.
