### Additional information

Cory is a friendly computer geek. He's sometimes a little shy when it comes to meeting new people, but he's a pretty nice guy and loves talking with his friends. Cory also has mild Asperger's Syndrome, a mild form of Autism, so sometimes he gets his feelings hurt a little too easily.
