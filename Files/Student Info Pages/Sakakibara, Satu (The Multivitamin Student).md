### Additional information

Satu is a shy girl with very colorful stockings. She was first found by Thomas in a video he made of the game in V0.41 ("Daigaku Gurashi Bruh Moments" by The Taco Masters), saying that she looked like a pack of multivitamins. As a result, Satu has become known as "The Multivitamin Student."
