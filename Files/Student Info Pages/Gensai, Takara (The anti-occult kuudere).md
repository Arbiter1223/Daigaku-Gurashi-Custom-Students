### Additional information

Takara was in the Occult Club during her freshman year. After making a mistake in a summoning ritual, however, the club leader Misaki turned the entire club against her. They started to blackmail Takara, trying to get her expelled from the school. Needless to say, Takara now despises the club, the occult itself, and even the school for letting the Occult Club get away with their wrongdoings. Since then, she has had a constant thirst for revenge against the club and especially Misaki.
