### Additional information

Jennyafur is my ~~waifu~~ all-time favorite OC from Daigaku Gurashi. She is a cheerful blonde neko girl, and she's pretty open-minded about things. She's very friendly, sweet, and a little nerdy as well. The name "Jennyafur" is a double play-on the nyaccent for the name "Jennifer" and is pronounced "Jen-nya-fur" ("ni" sound to "nya", "fer" to "fur"). (I tried coming up with a different name for a couple of reasons, but the name Jennyafur was just too cute and fit too well, and it kinda stuck. Her last name is also tied to the nyaccent as well.) While she can sometimes get a *little* pervy with some of her closer friends, Jennyafur is all-in-all a cute, sweet neko girl and a wonderful person to be with.
