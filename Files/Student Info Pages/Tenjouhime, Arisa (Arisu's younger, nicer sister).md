### Additional information

Arisa is Arisu's younger sister. When Arisa was born, her parents gave her all the love and often neglected her older sister Arisu. Because of this, Arisu grew to become very sour. Although they're almost identical in appearance, Arisu and Arisa are polar opposites in their personalities. Despite being blood-related to one of the biggest bullies in her class, Arisa is very friendly and fun to hang out with.
