### Additional information

Violet is a girl who was literally born with only half a brain. While it is miraculous that she is able to live with this condition, she lacks all intellectual capabilities and is purely emotion in nature. Her sister Verne was born with a similar brain condition, except that the opposite hemisphere was missing instead.
