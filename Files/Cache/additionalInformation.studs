Jenny is a quirky, fun, and friendly student. She's also VERY perverted, and she loves kissing all the girls in her class. Jenny is included as a Preset Student available in Daigaku Gurashi.

The (unofficial) most "default" character available. Default personality and stats, and all appearance options are set to lowest possible values. Fun fact: Shiro means "White" in Japanese!
Paizuri was the very first custom student uploaded to the custom students channel, uploaded by YamiToast himself. A masochistic tsundere kuudere yandere futanari, she also helped me gauge the description lengths of the other custom students in the database for quite some time. Although this is no longer the case since longer descriptions have been added, I've still had a bit of an attachment to Paizuri since the beginning (even though she was always a real bitch to me in-game).

Tsukiya is a quiet student originally from Osaka. Although he's a bit of a shy bookworm, he has a strange and macabre fascination with the occult.
A student from Dhujin Academy who lives a double life as a Phantom Thief. Based off the playable character in Persona 5.
A sweet person who is often bullied by his peers due to his sexuality.
Orangu is a character who was initially created by RedPanda/Retsuko (now under a different alias) as a first attempt at creating a character depicting Syberian Orange. Orangu is a close friend to Jennyafur since they look very similar and share common interests. (I also figured they would make best friends since Orangu was uploaded very close to the time I first shared Jennyafur.) I liked Orangu so much that I decided to keep her, along with a few other students, up-to-date with the game so she would always be playable. (I later decided to do this with all students, thus creating the Custom Student Database).

Arisa is Arisu's younger sister. When Arisa was born, her parents gave her all the love and often neglected her older sister Arisu. Because of this, Arisu grew to become very sour. Although they're almost identical in appearance, Arisu and Arisa are polar opposites in their personalities. Despite being blood-related to one of the biggest bullies in her class, Arisa is very friendly and fun to hang out with.
Despite having a hard time with her depression lately, Yarima is a confident and friendly girl.

A self-insert of the user RedPanda/Retsuko (now under a different alias), this character was in the initial group of students by other authors that I decided to keep up-to-date with the game (long before I created the Custom Student Database).
A character made to resemble Sammie/Majestical Discomfort, a former patron and the first female voice actor of Daigaku Gurashi. Part of the initial group of students by other authors that I decided to keep up-to-date with the game, before I even started the Custom Student Database.
Thomas from the Taco Masters (go check them out on YouTube), AKA motahs1, formerly known as "Toast".
Kamiko is a randomly-generated character that Syberian Orange found in her game. She shared Kamiko and described her as, "a shitty Arisu cosplayer." What most people don't know is that Kamiko actually looks like Jenny when she's not cosplaying, according to Syberian Inc. I got a good laugh from seeing Kamiko and decided to add her to the initial group of students that I decided to personally keep up-to-date with the game, long before the Custom Student Database was a thing.
Jennyafur is my ~~waifu~~ all-time favorite OC from Daigaku Gurashi. She is a cheerful blonde neko girl, and she's pretty open-minded about things. She's very friendly, sweet, and a little nerdy as well. The name "Jennyafur" is a double play-on the nyaccent for the name "Jennifer" and is pronounced "Jen-nya-fur" ("ni" sound to "nya", "fer" to "fur"). (I tried coming up with a different name for a couple of reasons, but the name Jennyafur was just too cute and fit too well, and it kinda stuck. Her last name is also tied to the nyaccent as well.) While she can sometimes get a *little* pervy with some of her closer friends, Jennyafur is all-in-all a cute, sweet neko girl and a wonderful person to be with.
Hana is a really cute and nice girl. She is nerdy and quite a bit shy, but this has unintentionally led to some people suspecting she is actually up to something...
Murasaki is a character Syberian Inc created for a friend whom she had convinced to start playing Daigaku Gurashi (Koukou Gurashi at the time). She wanted a character similar to Hisako in appearance who was also nice instead of mean. After the addition of multiple outfits to the game, Murasaki's fashion sense reminds me of the "Missing Texture" from the Source Engine.
July was a character created to celebrate Independence Day (the Fourth of July) in the United States.
Hotaru was a character created along with July to celebrate Independence Day (the Fourth of July) in the United States.

(*Based off the character from My Immortal.*) Hi, my name is Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way. I have long ebony black hair (that's how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reach my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears. A lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee, and if you don't know who she is then get the hell out of here! I'm not related to Gerard Way, but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I'm a vampire, but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I'm in the seventh year. I'm a Goth (in case you couldn't tell), and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic, and I buy all my clothes from there. For example, today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets, and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner, and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.
Pinku as a girl.

When Thomas streamed gameplay of Daigaku Gurashi (Koukou Gurashi at the time), his character bullied every student in his class to the point of suicide. Yoshie was the only exception, and she became his character's girlfriend.
When it was being debated whether or not Mayo, a *preset* student, should be changed from a female to a futa, I decided to act immediately. It had already been established that Mayo was a female, and I didn't like the idea of just changing stuff like this out of nowhere just to make "the perfect student." So to avoid having to make changes to the game canon, I made a futa version of Mayo to make everyone happy. (You're welcome.)
