Paizuri is a masochistic tsundere kuudere yandere futanari
Paizuri was the very first custom student uploaded to the custom students channel, uploaded by YamiToast himself. A mashochistic tsundere kuudere yandere futanari, she's also helped me gauge the description lengths of all the other custom students in the database; if it's shorter than Paizuri's description, it'll fit. XD Anyways, I've kinda had a bit of an attachment to Paizuri since the beginning (even though she was always a real bitch to me in-game DX), so I'll go ahead and upload her here right now. :)

17: Tenjouhime, Arisa (Arisu's younger, nicer sister) - Arbiter1223
Arisa is Arisu's younger(?) sister. Although they look exactly alike, they're complete opposites of each other personality-wise. Despite being blood-related to one of the biggest bullies at Shiro High School(?), Arisa is very friendly and fun to be with.
So either this is Arisu's nice sister, or Arisu went through intense therapy and rehab in order to make her friendly.. and changed her name afterwards XD
At least she can be a replacement for those who don't like megabitches XD
Arisa, the (unofficial-ish) older(?) and nicer sister of Arisu
Arisa is Arisu's older, nicer sister. When Arisa was born, her parents gave her all the love, but when Arisu was born, they often neglected her and paid all their attention to Arisa. Because of this, Arisu grew to be very sour. So although they look almost identical, Arisu and Arisa are polar opposites in personality.

Kamiko is a character that Syberian Orange initially found. She was a randomly generated character that looked a lot like Arisu. Orange thought she looked like a "lazy Arisu cosplayer," and I fell in love with her. Here she is.

I wanted to come up with a better name ("Jennyafur" is a play-on to "Jennifer" with a nyaccent, but I was still trying to think of something better XP)
Jennyafur is a very cheerful blonde neko girl (hence the alteration from the name "Jennifer"). She's very friendly and pretty open-minded about things.
she looks a lot like Orangu by coincidence, perhaps they could be related somehow?
Also, if you're wondering how to pronounce it, it's "Jen-nya-fur" :)
"n" sound to "nya", "fer" to "fur"
She's a nice, cute catgirl, very cheerful, and a good friend to be with.
Jennyafur is NOT a slut
nightara - Bein a perv doesn't really make ya a slut
Jennyafur is a cheerful blonde neko girl. She's very nice, nerdy, very cute, and a wonderful person to be with

This is Jennyafur (pronounced Jen-nya-fur), a cheerful blonde neko girl. She's really sweet and very friendly. She's also my waifu >w<
Reuploading my favorite custom student, Jennyafur Nyanako. She's a cheerful blonde catgirl who is very friendly and a bit nerdy as well.
She might also end up being good friends with Marina, actually! :D
witcharies - That's adorable!! I think they would too. Now I gotta draw them together
This here is Jennyafur Nyanako, a cute blonde neko girl. She's really sweet and a bit nerdy as well. :3
But of course, no student will ever replace my all-time favorite waifu student, Jennyafur Nyanako.
She's a very friendly and cheerful blonde neko girl
Now she has one of the new hairtail options added in V0.47
Also tweaked some of her other stats, but she's still the sweet girl that's been around as long as I have been in DgG
If I hear someone being mean to her, imma have to ~~kick someone's ass~~ *ehem* have a stern word with that person
I mean... ~~I may or may not still want her to be a *little* pervy~~...
but not to the point where she's open about it to *everyone*
Just the people she really likes is my actual intention
She's not a slut; she's a sweet neko girl more than anything

44: Masanobu, Raven (A mean kuudere masochistic girl) - Syberian Inc
Full name - Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way
First, last -  Ebony Way
Hi my name is Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that's how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN -  if u don't know who she is get da hell out of here!). I'm not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I'm a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I'm in the seventh year (I'm seventeen). I'm a goth (in case you couldn't tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.

I changed the "ちんぽ" (penis) variable to "True" XD
Yami - It's too good though. It's kinda wrong to make a character so perfect.
i gave her green boxers instead of panties. NOW she's perfect (for you XP)
I'm just saying, I didn't think *changing* an __official__ character to make her perfect sounded okay; so yeah, I just created an offbrand of a character
When it was being debated whether or not Mayo should be turned into a futa as a preset student, I decided to act immediately. Honestly it had been established that she was a girl, and I didn't like the idea of just changing stuff like this out of nowhere to make her "the perfect student." So, I made a futa version of her to make everyone happy. :)
(You're welcome)
(Yes, her name is supposed to be "Maya" instead of "Mayo")

This is Kaen, an evil, dark assassin girl. I made her a long time ago (I think back in V0.25) to simulate being a really mean bully. At the time, her name was "TheDarkSniper" but I didn't think it was too fitting, so I didn't upload her. "Kaen" means flames (thanks Yami! :D), so I thought it was fitting enough to upload her to the Custom Students Channel (she was already part of the database).
Kaen is an evil, dark assassin girl. Her dark past has made her into a cold-hearted person with no remorse.

157: Tamuro, Zane (A no-nonsense kind of guy) - Arbiter1223
Zane is another character I've had for a while. He's a no-nonsense kind of guy. Initially, he was my first attempt to combat Arisu. I never uploaded him because I felt he wasn't fit for uploading or something. I added him to the database, though, and I figured I could go ahead and upload him here while I'm getting the database set up.
Zane is a no-nonsense kind of guy. He isn't always mean to people, but he definitely won't let others push him around.
(Fun fact - Zane was my first attempt at trying to counter Arisu; this made me learn that you had to have friends so your depression doesn't take you over...) (Thankfully this was V0.25, before suicide was added to the game.)

171: Suenami, Eruko (A petty, promiscuous young woman) - Nyanako
Eruko is pretty much the opposite of Kirei's inception; traits fully set myself, looks almost fully randomized.
Eruko's extremely perverted and flirty, but also pretty bitchy. Doesn't get along well with most students (especially if said students don't like perversion), will probably flock to the other "mean" girls and end up hating them too after a while.

Keko is a Yandere cat girl ~~(a NYANdere)~~ ; she's pretty indifferent to things that aren't her hobbies or her crush and while she looks perfectly innocent, she's actually pretty heartless (unless you're her crush, of course.)
She's extremely active and perverted, likes the occult and perhaps a few other things. She ended up looking like a clefairy, somehow.

Renji's another student from my first playthrough I kept. I just opened up a game with her to take a picture and was amazed by how good her stats actually are; she's extremely smart, athletic, and confident. The reason why I'm surprised is because of one other trait; 
She's an extreme bitch. Part of the reason why I kept her was because of this, and I still throw her into a lot of my games to spice things up. I've very rarely Ever seen her have a positive interaction with another student.

	43: https://myimmortal.fandom.com/wiki/Ebony_Dark%27ness_Dementia_Raven_Way
		(*Based off the character from My Immortal.*) Hi, my name is Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way. I have long ebony black hair (that's how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reach my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears. A lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee, and if you don't know who she is then get the hell out of here! I'm not related to Gerard Way, but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I'm a vampire, but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I'm in the seventh year. I'm a Goth (in case you couldn't tell), and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic, and I buy all my clothes from there. For example, today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets, and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner, and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.
