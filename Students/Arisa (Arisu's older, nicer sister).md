# Arisa (Arisu's older, nicer sister)

<img src = "">

Name: Arisa

Description: Arisu's older, nicer sister. Because she was the first-born in her family, Arisa's parents always treated her with love and kindness. However, they often neglected her younger sister Arisu after she was born. Because of this, Arisa is much kinder than Arisu is. Although they look identical, Arisa is the polar opposite from Arisu in terms of personality.
