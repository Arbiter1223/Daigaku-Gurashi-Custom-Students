Welcome to the Koukou Gurashi Custom Student Database!

Here, you can view all of the custom student files currently in the database. When you view a student, it will display a picture of them and some general information about them as well as provide a download link for the actual .student file.

In the future, I'm thinking about allowing people to request pulls that would add their custom students to the database that way. At the moment, however, I will not accept pull requests because I need to set up everything and have a set format for the databse. I will open up pull requests when it's ready.

Just like the game, the Custom Student Database is a major work in progress, so bear that in mind for the moment as you browse through the students. Thank you, and enjoy your new classmates!
