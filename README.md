#### Note as of 12/11/2018
Sorry for the lack of progress lately; assignments and other things were impeding my progress. However, finals are pretty much over, and I can now get back to work on the database.

I'm thinking the best course of action right now would be to rebuild it from the ground up; I plan on doing a complete rewrite of the editor I wrote to manage the custom students, and I'm also using MatLab to help manage it as well. My primary goal, of course, is to get the students updated and online ASAP; I'll worry about getting pictures afterwards.

The best way for now to access the students is to enter the folder and find them there. I apologize for the mess at the moment; things aren't as organized as I would like.

You'll want to double check to make sure your student is compatable with V0.29 of Daigaku Gurashi! (Note: V0.28 students are compatable with V0.29, but V0.27 students are not. I'll get to updating them ASAP)

With finals over now, I'll be working full time to get the database back up to par. Sorry for the wait, and thank you for your patience!


## Welcome to the Daigaku Gurashi Custom Student Database!

Here, you can view all of the custom student files currently in the database. When you view a student, it will display a picture of them and some general information about them as well as provide a download link for the actual .student file. To save a student file, right-click the download link, and select "Save as".

In the future, I'm thinking about allowing people to request pulls that would add their custom students to the database that way. At the moment, however, I will not accept pull requests because I need to set up everything and have a set format for the databse. I will open up pull requests when it's ready.

Just like the game, the Custom Student Database is a major work in progress, so bear that in mind for the moment as you browse through the students.Thank you, and enjoy your new classmates!
