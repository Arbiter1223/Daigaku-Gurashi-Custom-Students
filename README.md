## Welcome to the Daigaku Gurashi Custom Student Database!

Here, you can view all of the custom student files currently in the database. When you view a student, it will (eventually) display a picture of them and some general information about them as well as provide a download link for the actual .student file. To save a student file, right-click the download link, and select "Save as".

Just like the game, the Custom Student Database is a major work in progress, so bear that in mind for the moment as you browse through the students. Thank you, and enjoy your new classmates!
